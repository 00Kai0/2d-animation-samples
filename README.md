# 2d-animation-samples

This repository contains samples of the 2D Animation features.

For use with Unity 2018.1b and newer.

## Challenges:
* Using the Transform Tools for manipulating bones in the Scene while posing and animating is not as fluid as we would like
* The skinning and rigging portion is done in the Scene View along with Hierarchy manipulation and IK setups
