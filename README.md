# 2d-animation-samples

This repository contains samples of the 2D Animation features.

For use with Unity 2018.1b and newer.

### Preview Feature Documentation
* **[2D Animation](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-animation-samples/blob/master/Documentation/2DAnimation.md)**
* **[Inverse Kinematics (IK)](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/2d-animation-samples/blob/master/Documentation/2DIK.md)**

## Challenges:
* Using the Transform Tools for manipulating bones in the Scene while posing and animating is not as fluid as we would like
* The skinning and rigging portion is done in the Scene View along with Hierarchy manipulation and IK setups
